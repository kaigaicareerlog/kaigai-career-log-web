## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Transcribe (once)
export ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your-key"
tsx scripts/transcribe-episode.ts cc15a703-73c7-406b-8abc-ad7d0a192d05

# Step 2: Clean up with AI (setup Groq)
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."
tsx scripts/cleanup-transcript.ts cc15a703-73c7-406b-8abc-ad7d0a192d05 groq

# Done! Check the result on your episode page
```

---

## Cost Estimates

For a typical 50-minute podcast (~400 utterances):

| Method | Time   | API Calls | Cost               |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| groq   | 15 min | 400       | **$0** (free tier) |
| gemini | 8 min  | 400       | **$0** (free tier) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "GROQ_API_KEY not set"

```bash
# Make sure you exported it
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."

# Or add to .env file
echo 'GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...' >> .env
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"

- **Groq:** Wait 1 minute, try again (30 req/min limit)
- **Gemini:** Wait 1 minute, try again (15 req/min limit)
- Script already includes delays to avoid this

### "Cost limit reached"

```bash
# Increase the limit
MAX_CLEANUP_COST=2.00 tsx scripts/cleanup-transcript.ts <guid> groq

# Or just use free tier (no cost anyway!)
```
