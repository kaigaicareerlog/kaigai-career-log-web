# X (Twitter) Post Automation

This document explains how to automatically post episode announcements to X (Twitter) using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The workflow allows you to post new episode announcements to X with a single click, including:

- Episode title
- Host information with X handles
- Links to all platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, Amazon Music)

## Setup

### 1. Get X API Credentials

You need to create an X Developer account and get API credentials with write permissions:

1. Go to [X Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
2. Create a new app (or use an existing one)
3. Set up **User authentication settings**:
   - Go to your app's settings
   - Click "Set up" under "User authentication settings"
   - App permissions: Select **Read and Write** (or **Read and Write and Direct Messages**)
   - Type of App: Choose **Web App, Automated App or Bot**
   - Fill in required URLs (can use placeholder URLs)
   - Save
4. Go to **Keys and tokens** section
5. Generate the following tokens:
   - **API Key and Secret** (Consumer Keys)
   - **Access Token and Secret** (with Read and Write permissions)
6. Copy all credentials (you won't be able to see them again!)

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret** for each:

**Required secrets:**

- `X_API_KEY` - Your API Key (Consumer Key)
- `X_API_SECRET` - Your API Secret (Consumer Secret)
- `X_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your Access Token (with Read and Write permissions)
- `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` - Your Access Token Secret

**Important:** Make sure your Access Token has **Read and Write** permissions, not just Read-only!

## Usage

### Via GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Select **Post Episode to X (Twitter)** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Fill in the inputs:
   - **Episode GUID**: Enter the episode's GUID (required)
   - **Include @togashi_ryo**: Check if Ryo is a host
   - **Include @onepercentdsgn**: Check if Senna is a host
   - **Include @ayacappuccino**: Check if Ayaka is a host
5. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow will automatically:

- Fetch episode data from the latest episodes file
- Format the main tweet with title, hosts, and hashtags
- Post the main tweet to X
- Post a reply tweet with all platform links (Apple, Spotify, YouTube, Amazon Music)
- Create a clean thread format

### Via Command Line (Local Testing)

```bash
# Export your X API credentials
export X_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export X_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
export X_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
export X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="your_access_token_secret"

# Post with single host
npm run post-to-x "episode-guid" "@togashi_ryo"

# Post with multiple hosts
npm run post-to-x "episode-guid" "@togashi_ryo, @onepercentdsgn"

# Example with real GUID
npm run post-to-x "d44556c1-c327-4716-bb57-4d0a4ed55e14" "@togashi_ryo, @onepercentdsgn"
```

## Tweet Format

The script creates a thread with two tweets:

### Main Tweet (Tweet 1):

```
üéßPodcastÊñ∞„Ç®„Éî„ÇΩ„Éº„ÉâÂÖ¨Èñã

[Episode Title]

Host
@togashi_ryo, @onepercentdsgn

#Êµ∑Â§ñ #Êµ∑Â§ñÂ∞±ËÅ∑ #„Ç≠„É£„É™„Ç¢
```

### Reply Tweet (Tweet 2):

```
Apple
[Apple Podcast URL]

Spotify
[Spotify URL]

Youtube
[YouTube URL]

Amazon Music
[Amazon Music URL]
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚ú® Cleaner main tweet focused on the episode announcement
- üîó All platform links organized in a reply thread
- üìè No character limit issues
- üëÄ Better readability and engagement

**Note:** X automatically shortens all URLs to t.co links (~23 characters each).

## Troubleshooting

### "X_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable is required"

Make sure you've added all required secrets (`X_API_KEY`, `X_API_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) to your GitHub repository.

### "X API error: 401 Unauthorized"

This usually means:

- Your Access Token doesn't have **Read and Write** permissions (regenerate with correct permissions)
- Your credentials are invalid or expired
- Your app's authentication settings are not configured correctly

**Solution:**

1. Go to X Developer Portal ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí User authentication settings
2. Make sure "Read and Write" is selected
3. Regenerate your Access Token and Secret
4. Update the GitHub secrets

### "X API error: 403 Forbidden"

Your app may not have the necessary permissions or the endpoint is restricted for your access level.

### "At least one host must be selected"

You must select at least one host checkbox when running the workflow.

### Thread Posting

The script now posts as a thread:

1. **Main tweet**: Episode announcement with title, hosts, and hashtags
2. **Reply tweet**: All platform URLs

This keeps the main tweet clean and avoids character limit issues. Both tweets are posted automatically in sequence.

## API Rate Limits

X API has rate limits for posting:

- **Free tier**: 1,500 tweets per month (50 per day)
- **Basic tier**: 3,000 tweets per month ($100/month)
- **Pro tier**: 10,000 tweets per month

For this podcast announcement workflow, the Free tier should be more than sufficient!

## Tweet URL Shortening

X automatically converts all URLs to t.co short links:

- Each URL becomes ~23 characters regardless of original length
- This happens automatically when you post
- The script shows both the original character count and estimated shortened length
