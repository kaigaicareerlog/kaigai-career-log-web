# Cursor Development Rules

## Code Organization

- Always create reusable modules
- Abstract duplicated code and place it in common locations
- Design components and modules to be easily reusable
- Use existing common components or modules before creating new ones
- Follow proper separation of concerns

## Directory Structure

- **scripts/**
  - Script files used by GitHub Actions or local commands
- **src/**
  - **components/** - Common components used by layouts or pages
  - **constants/** - Constant definitions
  - **layouts/** - Layout files used by pages
  - **pages/** - Astro pages
  - **utils/** - Utility functions

## Best Practices

- Never leave utility functions or reusable logic directly in page or component files
- Place utility functions in `src/utils/`
- Place reusable components in `src/components/`
- Place constants in `src/constants/`
